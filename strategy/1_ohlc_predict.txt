dataset ohlcv
{sid, StkQuotc}
sid:stock id

StkQuotc:
	ymd[]
	o[]
	h[]
	l[]
	c[]
	v[]
	
	
for all the dataset, i want to check the up/down trend/probability according to previous few days pattern.
x:	
b1 = o[day-3]-c[day-4]>0
b2 = c[day-3]-c[day-4]>0
b3 = o[day-2]-c[day-3]>0
b4 = c[day-2]-c[day-3]>0
b5 = o[day-1]-c[day-2]>0
b6 = c[day-1]-c[day-2]>0

case = b1+b2*2 + b3*4 ...

y:
(c[day+3] - o[day-0]) /o[day-0]


output statitistic:
case case_count y_avg y_std y_at_20% y_at_80%
0
